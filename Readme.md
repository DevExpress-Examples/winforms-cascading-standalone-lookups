# WinForms LookupEdit - Filter a standalone lookup based on a value in another lookup

This example demonstrates how to implement cascading lookups. When a user selects a category in the first lookup, the second lookup filters its items to display only products that match the selected category.

Use the secondary lookupâ€™s [CascadingOwner](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraEditors.LookUpEditBase.CascadingOwner) property to specify the primary lookup. Lookups use an internal algorithm that identifies a key field in a data source. The algorithm checks the names of data objects, the key attributes, and the data type of the primary keys. The algorithm is based on a common naming convention of key fields (for example, `ID`, `Key`, and `OID`).

```csharp
lookUpEdit2.CascadingOwner = lookUpEdit1;
```

> **Note**
>
> The `CascadingOwner` property is supported only for standalone lookup editors. Read the following help topic for information on how to create cascading in-place lookups: [Cascading Lookups](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/116018/controls-and-libraries/editors-and-simple-controls/lookup-editors/cascading-lookups).
